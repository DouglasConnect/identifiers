# European Repository of Materials

The European Repository of Materials is a simple registry with the sole purpose to mint material
identifiers to be used by research projects throughout the life cycle of their project. The
identifier is nothing more than that identifier, and not by default linked to any information.
Think of it as a pre-registration of the intention to study the material.

Once the identifier is created by a research project, the idea is that it is used throughout the
whole study, from the design to the final reporting. It is meant to be used as unique, persistant
identifier to be used in descriptions of experimental designs, in (open) notebooks, in reports,
in project milestones and deliverables, and in journal articles.

## The identifier

The identifier can be used in two ways. For regular writing, it can be used as in its compact
form. For semantic web approaches, the full IRI can be used. Both will be considered equivalent
and refer to the same identifier.

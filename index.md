# European Repository of Materials

The European Repository of Materials is a simple registry with the sole purpose to mint material
identifiers to be used by research projects throughout the life cycle of their project. The
identifier is nothing more than that identifier, and not by default linked to any information.
Think of it as a pre-registration of the intention to study the material.

More information is provided in this [README](README.md).

## How to register new materials

The process to register new materials is described in [this document](register.md).
